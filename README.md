# 6-letter Wordle

This React app is an alternative version to the popular game Wordle, owned by the New York Times, which gives you a 5-letter word to guess every day.\
This version works the same way but for guessing 6-letter words.

## Available Scripts

### `yarn start`

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn dev`

Builds and runs the app in development mode.

### `yarn build`
